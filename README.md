# DOCKER REPOSITORY

This repository stores both my current and archived docker run, docker compose and docker swarm files.

## Repo breakdown

### Single Container Deployment

- **compose** folder: Docker-compose yml files
- **compose -archive** folder: Archive for docker-compose files
- **run**: Docker run txt files
- **run-archive**: Archive for docker run files

### Stacks Deployment

- **stack** folder: Docker-compose **stacks** yml files
- **stacj - archive** folder: Archive for docker-compose **stack** files

### Swarm Deployment

- **swarm** folder: Docker-compose **swarm** yml files
- **swarm - archive** folder: Archive for docker-compose **swarm** files
  <br>

Anything with **archive** is obviously not maintained but I decided to keep the files for future reference.

All other folders store what I am currently running in docker.

Feel free to use whatever helps in your docker adventures!

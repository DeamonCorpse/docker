# DOCKER REPOSITORY

Storage for both my current and archived docker run, compose, stack and swarm files.

---



## ARCHIVES

### docker-application-stacks

- Docker stack files which contain **more than one application to be deployed**.

### docker-individual-stacks

- As the name suggests, there are stack files but they each **deploy only one application**.
- I tend to group applications based on their functionality so this folder is not used much and is kept.

### docker-run

- Although I do prefer to use stacks, I also sometimes use docker-run to have a look at an application and see if I want to use it.

### docker-swarm

- Watching all the "kings and queens of ducker" on youtube, I was convinced docker swarm was the way to go...Turned out if was not.


Feel free to use whatever helps in your docker adventures!
